# How to install gmosh on OS X

This is the "prebuilt" package for gmosh on OS X. That means that you don't have to compile anything yourself.
All you have to do is install it.

First make sure the program "make" is installed.
Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities) and type "whereis make". If nothing is outputted then you need to install make.
Installation of make depends on what version of OS X you have:
	OS X 10.9 and later:
		Run "xcode-select --install" in the Terminal and follow the prompts
		Despite the name, this does not require Xcode and does not install Xcode in the process (unless you pick "Get Xcode")
	OS X 10.8 and earlier:
		You have a few options:
			Check https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer,
			Install the "Command Line Tools" from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ - Apple account required,
			Or install Xcode from the App Store (it's a large download) and go to Preferences > Downloads and install the "Command Line Tools".
There are other options for both but these are the easiest.

Now open a terminal in this folder (the folder with "makefile" in it) and run
	sudo make install_osx

This installs the program to your system.
