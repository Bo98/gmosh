# How to install gmosh on OS X

This is the "prebuilt" package for gmosh on OS X. That means that you don't have to compile anything yourself.
All you have to do is install it.

Either double click install.command or run it from Terminal.
The program will ask for your root password (your Mac's password) if it doesn't have it already.
This installs the program to your system.
