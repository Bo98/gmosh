# How to install gmosh on Linux

This is the "prebuilt" package for gmosh on Linux. That means that you don't have to compile anything yourself.
All you have to do is install it.

Either double click install.sh or run it from the terminal.
The program will ask for sudo access if it doesn't have it already.
This installs the program to your system.
