# How to install gmosh on Linux

This is the "prebuilt" package for gmosh on Linux. That means that you don't have to compile anything yourself.
All you have to do is install it.

First make sure the program make is installed.
	"sudo apt-get install make" on Debian based systems
	"pacman -S make" on Arch based systems
	"yum install make" on distros that have yum
	or whatever package manager you use. Seriously though, it should already be on your system.


Open a terminal in this folder (the folder with "makefile" in it) and run
	sudo make install

This installs the program to your system.
