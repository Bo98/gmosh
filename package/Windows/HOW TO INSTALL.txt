Run setup.exe.

Making a desktop shortcut and/or start menu is recommended. Otherwise you might not be able to find it.

Also, note that there are TWO programs: gmosh and gmoshui.
- gmosh is a command line interface program. Since you're using Windows, you're probably don't see the merit in programs that you run from the command prompt. That's why for you lot I have:
- gmoshui. This can do everything gmosh can do *and more*. Gmoshui has a gui, which means you can *click* on things. It's a lot more user friendly, so you'll probably use that instead.

I'm just saying, if you happen to use git with git bash, gmosh is pretty fucking superb, since publishing to the workshop requires *no* command line parameters if set up correctly. And by set up correctly I mean that you have a "workshopid: 12345" field in your addon.json.
