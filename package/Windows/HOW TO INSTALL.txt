Right click install.bat and click "Run as administrator".

Not running it as administrator might prevent the gmosh executable from being added to the PATH variable.
That will give you a "Command not found" when you enter "gmosh" in the command prompt.

Uninstalling is done in much the same way:
Right click uninstall.bat and click "Run as administrator".
